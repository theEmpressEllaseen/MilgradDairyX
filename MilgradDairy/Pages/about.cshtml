    <p>The factory was built and put into operation with a design capacity of 110 tons of processed milk per shift in August 1977. The construction of a new plant in the Bryansk region was caused by the need to process "extra" milk, the introduction of waste-free technologies.</p>

    <p>"The packaging design for Milgrad is absolutely outstanding and exceptional. The concept of showing a kitten in different poses and having it run around all sides of the packaging is clever and very well executed. The possibility to play with this design on the shelf and thus build up different scenarios is equally ingenious."</p>
